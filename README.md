# Community governance

This is home of City of Zion (CoZ) community rules and reports.
Our formalization reflects a humble move from the NEO team to receive our contributions and provide support for quality work.

The community is free to choose its own targets and objectives. That said, our goal is to improve NEO, so we will align with the NEO team's needs and avoid re-work as much as possible, unless it is to attain a new level of quality.

The initial structure is:

1 - There will be a council that is always formed by 9 people. They are the team [council in our org](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfZion/teams/council/members)

2 - There will be a high council formed of 4 members of the council. They are the [maintainers of the council](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfZion/teams/council/members?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=%20role%3Amaintainer)

3 - Any member of CoZ can create and collaborate on projects.

4 - There will be a weekly report delivered to NEO by the high council via a PGP signed email and correspondent pull-request on GitHub.

5 - In case of any support from NEO as reward or bounty, the funds will initially be held by a trusted third-party in wallet AXSoNQEKjmqPBNPg5cNrHyWivfjok3Vj9D for distribution.

6 - After the 1st of September in 2017, all CoZ funds will be held in a multi-sig of the high council that requires a majority to unlock.

7 - Rewards distribution will be voted on by project, before being received. There must be a majority agreement of all 9 council members.

8 - All decisions not explicitly treated in this list will be voted as item 7.

9 - Item 7 voting polls of the council will run for 1 week on the #council slack channel and after closing will be published in the #dev channel.

10 - The high council will be voted on every quarter, we will sync with years quarters. The first election will be on 1 October 2017. The newly elected high council can propose changes to this rules during the 1st week after the election, changes should be voted as item 7.

11 - Any member of the council or high council is free to give-up the position at any time, and when this happens a election will take place and a majority of council members must decide on a replacement.

12 - Any member of the council that does not vote on polls for more them 2 months will automatically give-up the position.
